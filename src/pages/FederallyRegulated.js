        <h1>Do federal holidays apply to me?</h1>

        <p>
          Probably not, but it depends on your job. Most Canadian workers get provincial holidays
          off, not federal ones.

        <h2>Who’s federally regulated?</h2>
        <p>
          All jobs in Canada are regulated by <strong>a provincial government</strong> or
          ${' '}<strong>the federal government</strong>. If your job is regulated by the federal
          government, you get federal holidays instead of the provincial holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
          Approximately 6% of Canadians work in federally regulated industries. Some examples are:
        </p>
        <ul class="no-space">
          <li>banks</li>
          <li>airlines</li>
          <li>post offices</li>
          <li>the federal civil service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h2>What’s the difference?</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, provincial holidays are the same as federal holidays — like Christmas, or New
          Year’s — but not always.
        </p>
        <p>For example, the province of Ontario doesn’t observe Remembrance Day, which means</p>
        <ul>
          <li>on November 11, post offices are closed but schools are open</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          However, Ontario observes Family Day but the federal government doesn’t. So that means
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>on the third Monday in February, schools are closed but post offices will be open</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How can I tell which holidays apply to me?</h2>
        <p>
          Most likely you get provincial holidays, but if you’re not sure, you can ask someone you
          work with or check out${' '}
